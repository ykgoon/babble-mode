# babble-mode

## Summary

This is for the first half of the
[babble & prune](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pC6DYFLPMTCbEwH8W) 
process.

`babble-mode` is a minor mode for your buffer. Running it will
give you an urge to keep writing without stopping (in other
word, babble).

Pausing for too long and all your writings will be erased.

## Why

This is less about productivity and more like a game that
encourage your creativity. For quality writing to emerge,
bad writings have to first come out.

Think of it like creative diarrhea. When junks are babbled out
completely, then the pruning/editing process can start.

## Running

`M-x babble-mode`

## Installing

```
(babble-mode :location (recipe
                        :fetcher github
                        :repo "ykgoon/babble-mode"
                        :commit "0.1"))
```
